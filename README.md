Lightbroom
--

Back in 2003, I created [this repostory](https://github.com/zz85/lightbroom/commit/124270abe79588366e7bd041f32851aa548ddbc9) because I had some wild ideas of building a better replacement to my lightroom workflow... (yeah it is never that easy but one can always have dreams...)

## Current State

An Instagram-like desktop app developed with Electron and Web technologies for a simple photo retouching workflow.
This iteration currently uses [CSSgram](https://github.com/una/CSSgram/) (which uses GPU accelerated CSS filters and blend modes) for instgram like filters.
